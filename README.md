# Ailocks:Ai2Ai Network Demo

Ai2Ai Network was inspired by the concept of secure, user-controlled AI assistants (‘Ailocks’) and the need for a system that allows specialised AI to easily collaborate to solve complex problems for users. The project aims to provide location-aware and user-aware products and services by facilitating interaction between personalised AI assistants.

We believe that a world where everyone has their own "Jarvis" (Ailock) is more attractive than a world full of Terminators and Agent Smiths.
